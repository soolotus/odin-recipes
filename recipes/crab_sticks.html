    <p>When you crave crab but can’t swing the real deal, these fried imitation crab legs hit the spot. Look for “leg style” imitation crab in the freezer section. Imitation crab tends to be on the sweet side, so I serve them with lemon wedges and cocktail sauce, but feel free to dip them in sweet chili sauce if you like things sweeter.</p>
