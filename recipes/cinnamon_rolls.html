    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package rapid-rise yeast</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Icing:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat milk, water, and 1/4 cup butter together in a saucepan over medium heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Let cool to 120 to 130 degrees F (49 to 54 degrees C), 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, white sugar, salt, and yeast together in a separate bowl. Mix egg into warm milk mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour milk mixture and 1/3 of the flour mixture into a mixing bowl; beat using an electric mixer until moistened. Add remaining dry ingredients slowly until a dough has pulled together. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 8 minutes. Place in a covered bowl and let rise in a dry, warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Roll on a lightly floured surface into a 16x12-inch rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup softened butter evenly over dough. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in small bowl and sprinkle evenly over dough. Roll up from the short side; cut into 12 even rolls.</li>
        <li>Place rolls into a greased 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Cover and let rise in a dry, warm place, 8 hours, to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 17 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat cream cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, milk, and vanilla extract for icing using an electric mixer in a bowl until creamy; slowly mix in confectioners' sugar until smooth.        </li>
        <li>Remove cinnamon rolls from the oven and flip out onto a cooling rack; let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes, before covering in icing.</li>
    </ol>
